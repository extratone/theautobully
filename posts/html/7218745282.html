<p>Today, I was fortunate enough to be up at 5AM.  I took my daily driver through my favorite local 10 minute route to witness the sunrise.  Which really wasn&rsquo;t all that great because it was overcast.  Still, the drive was gorgeous.  I caught a few photos and put them up on the <a title="The Auto Bully Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theautobully/">TAB Flickr</a>. </p>
