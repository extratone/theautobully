				"content_html": "<p>The 1990s. Not the greatest time for the United States auto industry. In those days, with a few exceptions, American cars were all overpriced, devoid of quality and generally unreliable. The big three (along with many other non-automotive related corporations in the U.S.) had an aging generation of management. This group decided that the ideal way to run their business involved expending the least amount of effort into their products as possible, without reducing the price paid by customers. Essentially, they hoped to gain more profit from less product. I don’t have to tell you that this thinking just…doesn’t work.\nI would theorize that this mentality came from overconfidence and a lack of joy in production. GM, Ford, and Dodge had been the top sellers of the automobile in the United States since its invention. They originally symbolized the best in quality, luxury and performance. Consumer and producer shared the same values, resulting in a flourishing market. It was a joyous time. And then, somewhere around the 1973 oil crisis, the joy began seeping out of our star shooters. Maybe it was emissions regulations, a loss of those ideal values, or some other factor. Regardless of the source, our homegrown auto industry lost its passion. It reflected in the cars that were built. Designs were reused, progression was halted, the irreverence of quality workmanship lost. “American dependability” became an ironic statement.</p>\n<p>And then came along a company that had been building little, noisy two-stroke engines to fit to bicycles only four decades earlier, proudly displaying a banner the changing public couldn’t refuse. They offered a product that was simple, honest, reliable, durable and reasonably priced. A concoction that smelled an awful lot like high value. An odor that no doubt brought back old memories. The Accord, suburban America’s new family pet. And the Civic, conveniently debuted in 1972. The college student’s greatest companion. Both were conservatively styled and equipped, and thus quite easily ignored, which was exactly what the country wanted. After all those years stranded on the shoulders of our aging interstate system in lumbering, underpowered beasts, the indestructible and dependable qualities of the Hondas came as a breath of fresh air.\nSo. What made the newcomers so different? What was the driving force behind the value of the products? It was something not unknown to the Americans, and its presence had been sorely missed. Picture an ancient sage by the name of Soichiro Honda saying something to the order of “Lets build the best automobile we can and sell it for as little as possible.” Though the man is more a symbol than an actual influence on the four-wheeled endeavors of the institution bearing his name, he represents what led to the same group’s success. Honda was untainted by an unrealistic attitude, and unaided by a century of heritage and good reputation. They succeeded only because they built good cars.</p>\n<p>By 2008, Honda had more than made a name for itself. Over the past decade, though, the prices had been steadily increasing, along with the level of luxury and complexity available in their cars. Both the Accord and Civic were bestsellers in their respective classes, and had held their titles for a relatively long time. It was then that I personally theorized they might take the same path American carmakers had taken only a short while before. I don’t want to brag, but this was long before Ron Kiino’s bold title “Is Hyundai the new Honda?” graced the pages of MotorTrend’s October 2011 issue. And it was really a far-fetched notion at the time. Simply a suspicion.\nConfidently and stubbornly, the Accord held its grip on mid-size sedan sales in the United States, complimented by the Toyota Camry, a similar-looking but even more ignorable competitor. The former still held appeal for someone with the capacity to enjoy themselves. The latter, however, has always been the most desirable choice of individuals that absolutely despise driving. They both held their slightly different niches, with no real fear of losing their place. Then, Honda started skimping a bit on quality. Motoring journalists noticed a lack of improving fuel economy, aging transmissions, and a general loss in competitive edge in the 2011 Accord. Not the best time to start slacking on Honda’s part.</p>\n<p>This was the year that Hyundai unveiled the brilliantly-updated 6th generation Sonata. I consider this to be the most significant car to come in the mid-sized segment since the birth of the Accord/Camry duo. In previous generations, it had always been competitively priced. The quality, though, had been lacking. The Koreans were not afraid to design a car that was much less conservative than the two Japanese giants. However, the designs were never really all that great looking. Interesting and different? Yes. Attractive?….No. So these attributes kept Honda and Toyota secure under their cozy comforter of sales, not intimidated by Hyundai’s offering. And that’s quite understandable. The Sonata never really seemed a direct competitor to the giants.\nThe new one, however, completely changed the game. For one thing, it’s gorgeous. Not conservatively pretty, but ridiculous, in the best sort of way. Poised and angular, the exterior looks as if it should cost exponentially more than it does. They managed to carry on the Sonata’s tradition of unique styling by rejecting the old car completely and replacing it with a stunner. The interior reflects a similar attitude. It’s not only good looking, but significantly more fuel efficient than any other mid-sized car on the market. The drivetrain options are excellent. The best part, though, is the price. At a starting MSRP of 19,195 USD, it is several thousand less than any competitor.</p>\n<p>All of this really just makes the Accord and Camry look silly. It’s interesting that Hyundai should take up Honda’s original niche, given how different their backgrounds are. Our original hero of practicality was created by a man tinkering with small motorcycles. The former, however, was founded as a massive construction firm, only later trying its hand in the realm of automobiles. Cars seemed an alternative for Hyundai, but certainly not an afterthought. Regardless of where they came from, these two companies have had very similar philosophies, if only separated by time. Also, both have had to rely on sheer ingenuity for profit, without the foothold of heritage in the American market.\nIt could be said, though, that Hyundai is doing a bit better. High value cars that are practical and interesting as an experience. Honda could never get that last bit quite right. Or perhaps it’s just a sign of the times. Maybe Americans have overcome the compulsion to ignore our cars. My question is this; Has this flip-flop in production attitude become a cycle? And if so, who will be in the hot spot next? My bet is on the big three, believe it or not. A new generation of management has brought about a huge improvement in our products. It could even be one of the rising Chinese companies in the future. Who knows?\nI can tell you that right now, though, Hyundai has got the goods.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I recently had the chance to drive the facelifted 2013 Mazda MX-5. This is the first time the looks of the perky roadster have changed since the front-mounted smile became an all-out grin of insanity in 2008. They have once again dulled it to what I would call a smirk. The new front end blends with the rest of car more than it has in the past. It seems to have grown a bit more serious. In fact, with black 17-inch alloys on a glossy black (creatively called “Brilliant Black,”) this example is the most aggressive-looking of any Miata I have seen. That’s not to say it’s aggressive in the slightest, even in such a scheme. This car is in the “Club” trim replacing the previous “Touring” designation as the top-of-the-line option. This selection adds ridiculous three-leaf clover side badges, red stitching on the seats, red stripes on the dash and sides, along with a price tag very near 30,000 USD.</p>\n<p>So I present you with my first problem with this particular car….it’s a contradiction. The MX-5 was never intended to look serious. That grin was there to convey the primary attribute aspired to by its creators; joy. It’s designed to be joyful in driving and the exterior of previous generations did a good job of communicating what the car is all about. Unfortunately, it seems they have decided that it’s time for the roadster to grow up. Frankly, that’s not going to work.</p>\n<p>Now, to the drive.\nFor this year, the car has been lightened, the braking response quickened, as well as the throttle response in manual-equipped cars. Unfortunately, I was only able to drive the 6-speed automatic with optional pattle-shifters. Given that this is my first drive in an NC (third generation) MX-5, I can only compare it to my own NB.\nImmediately, my passenger and chaperon, Perry Cunningham of Joe Machens Mitsubishi/Fiat starts the process of opening the optional retractable hard top. Open air is this car’s natural environment, and it appears that somebody got busy making sure its occupants never notice. Wind buffeting has been drastically reduced. Perry and I were able to maintain conversation beyond 70mph without necessitating shouting thanks to a much taller wind brake behind our seats. Unfortunately, I couldn’t really hear much of anything from the 158-hp 2.0L 4 up front, even with liberal amounts of right foot burying. It would seem the optional dual exhaust outlets are rather pointless then.</p>\n<p>Getting in the car, I had expected the experience to be ruined by the 6-speed auto. Buying a Miata with an automatic is sort of like going on a scenic vacation without a camera. It doesn’t necessarily ruin the immediate experience but you’ll always have some regret regarding the subject in the future. The pattles add some of the fun back in, but I prefer the Golf GTI’s arrangement of right side-shift up, left side-shift down, while the MX-5 has both functions on either side of the wheel. It took some deliberate self-coaching to get used to, but it won’t effect your daily driving experience. Another plus; when in manual shift mode, it is truly manual, meaning the transmission will allow you to exceed the redline. It may sound trivial, but being nannied when you’re first told that you’re in control can be a major annoyance. (Looking at you, Kia Forte.) It’s disappointing that Mazda chose only to up throttle response in manual-equipped cars. This one most certainly needed it.\nThe original Miata was built on a philosophy of communication between driver and machine, summarized in the Japanese phrase “Jinba Ittai,” meaning “rider and horse are one.” Being an MX-5 owner, this philosophy is very important to me, thus my expectations for the steering were very high. It was very disappointing, then, to discover that it has been very nearly ruined. The leather-wrapped steering wheel was comfortable, yes, but not very generous in revealing the road. In corners it felt jumpy, imprecise, and unsure of itself. The same lack of self-confidence was noticeable in a straight line as well, along with a nervous fidget. Keep in mind, I am comparing this to roadsters of the past, not to other automobiles currently on the market. It would take a global nuclear war to make the MX-5 less fun to drive than a Toyota Camry.\nThough it has lost communication and soul, the Miata has gained a more comfortable suspension and oodles of storage space. The trunk is massive for a roadster of this size, and the example I drove was equipped with an optional storage compartment extending behind the seats, especially handy for CDs, candy, and the like. The center console contains two reasonably-sized cupholders obscured by a sliding door that will inevitably lead to annoyance in single-drink occasions. Mr. Cunningham also pointed out to me that the track on which the door slides appears vulnerable to crumbs. Only time will tell, I suppose.</p>\n<p>In general, being inside the car is a much more comfortable experience, albeit a boring one. It seems to me that the MX-5 has “grown up,” forgoing fun for comfort and practicality. And is that not exactly the opposite of the direction it should be moving? It was never meant to be an aggressive-looking performance car, and it will never do well as one. It will never be luxurious enough to be a true touring car, either.</p>\n<p>Its soul has made it the top-selling roadster of all time, and I’m afraid it’s losing it, bit by bit. To be honest, if you’re attracted by the values on which the original Miata was built, I would recommend a Subaru BRZ/Toyota GT 86/Scion FR-S. The recommendation does not come lightly or easily.\nUntil Mazda gets wise about what it’s doing to the beloved little car, I’m afraid it’s headed down a path that will mean losing a grip on the niche it’s held for so long, and that’s quite saddening.\nA very hearty thanks to Mr. Perry Cunningham and Joe Machens Mitsubishi/Fiat.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

The trunk is massive for a roadster of this size, and the example I drove was equipped with an optional storage compartment extending behind the seats, especially handy for CDs, candy, and the like. The center console contains two reasonably-sized cupholders obscured by a sliding door that will inevitably lead to annoyance in single-drink occasions. Mr. Cunningham also pointed out to me that the track on which the door slides appears vulnerable to crumbs. Only time will tell, I suppose.\n\nIn general, being inside the car is a much more comfortable experience, albeit a boring one. It seems to me that the MX-5 has “grown up,” forgoing fun for comfort and practicality. And is that not exactly the opposite of the direction it should be moving? It was never meant to be an aggressive-looking performance car, and it will never do well as one. It will never be luxurious enough to be a true touring car, either.\n\nIts soul has made it the top-selling roadster of all time, and I’m afraid it’s losing it, bit by bit. To be honest, if you’re attracted by the values on which the original Miata was built, I would recommend a Subaru BRZ/Toyota GT 86/Scion FR-S. The recommendation does not come lightly or easily.\nUntil Mazda gets wise about what it’s doing to the beloved little car, I’m afraid it’s headed down a path that will mean losing a grip on the niche it’s held for so long, and that’s quite saddening.\nA very hearty thanks to Mr. Perry Cunningham and Joe Machens Mitsubishi/Fiat.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/33355421733-0.jpg\"> <img src=\"uploads/2025/33355421733-1.jpg\"> <img src=\"uploads/2025/33355421733-2.jpg\"> <img src=\"uploads/2025/33355421733-3.jpg\"> <img src=\"uploads/2025/33355421733-4.jpg\"> <img src=\"uploads/2025/33355421733-5.jpg\"> \n",

(below)</p>\n<p>Of course, I immediately knew the implications of such a thing, but I initially attributed it to a simple prank in an attempt at the defense of my conscious mind. Though, after reasoning for a few seconds, I realized that April is still some 6 months away, and the management of Nissan is way too stupid to attempt humor.\nOh shit.\nPardon my bias, but you know an article is going to annihilate your weekly charisma with such a disgusting header.  Combining the freakish, ridiculous Juke with the soulless-yet-successful GT-R has to be on the same level as history’s greatest crimes against humanity.</p>\n<p>The question that seems to best define Nissan for me, personally is “Why?&quot; </p>\n<p>Why create the Cube?\nWhy give it drum brakes?\nWhy show a luxury coupe power-sliding around an urban area in a luxury television commercial? \nEven without my ridiculous, unfounded disgust of the company, WHY on this Earth would you want to put the drivetrain of a top-selling rear-wheel-driven supercar into the hideous, disfigured body of a washout front-wheel-driven crossover?!\nWell, after returning to a somewhat reasonable state as the grief from the first sight of the logo subsided, I scrolled down to find the video embedded below.</p>\n<p>Episode 1 of &ldquo;Let’s Build the Worst Thing We Can Come Up With”\n…and this Darren Cox fellow answered my question.\n“We’re a very innovative company, and we just like doing really crazy stuff like this.”\nI’m sorry…did I hear him right?  Did he just justify this thing in the name of “innovation?!”\nBULL SHIT \nThere is absolutely nothing new, beneficial, or inventive about the waste of valuable time and resources unfolding right in front of that camera’s lens. \n“If you look at our history, there are many examples of Nissan engineers really driving forward the business.”\nYes!  There are!  And every single one of them would collectively haul your ass back to a theology class.  Or maybe a psychology class.\nJust anywhere the chance exists that you’ll learn some damned morals!\nTo sum it up, this is possibly the most pointless, disgusting thing Nissan has ever created, even surpassing the Cube.  Sure, it’s not going on sale.  And initially, you may question why you should care.  Well…you should care because Nissan is stupid.  They are gaining nothing from this.  It’s about as wild as goose chases get.  Millions of dollars and thousands of man hours are being poured into something that has no logical value whatsoever.  </p>\n<p>In this new video, I describe my reaction to discovering this thing.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

Though, after reasoning for a few seconds, I realized that April is still some 6 months away, and the management of Nissan is way too stupid to attempt humor.\nOh shit.\nPardon my bias, but you know an article is going to annihilate your weekly charisma with such a disgusting header.  Combining the freakish, ridiculous Juke with the soulless-yet-successful GT-R has to be on the same level as history’s greatest crimes against humanity.\n\nThe question that seems to best define Nissan for me, personally is “Why?\" \n\nWhy create the Cube?\nWhy give it drum brakes?\nWhy show a luxury coupe power-sliding around an urban area in a luxury television commercial? \nEven without my ridiculous, unfounded disgust of the company, WHY on this Earth would you want to put the drivetrain of a top-selling rear-wheel-driven supercar into the hideous, disfigured body of a washout front-wheel-driven crossover?!\nWell, after returning to a somewhat reasonable state as the grief from the first sight of the logo subsided, I scrolled down to find the video embedded below.\n\n\nEpisode 1 of \"Let’s Build the Worst Thing We Can Come Up With”\n…and this Darren Cox fellow answered my question.\n“We’re a very innovative company, and we just like doing really crazy stuff like this.”\nI’m sorry…did I hear him right?  Did he just justify this thing in the name of “innovation?!”\nBULL SHIT \nThere is absolutely nothing new, beneficial, or inventive about the waste of valuable time and resources unfolding right in front of that camera’s lens.  \n“If you look at our history, there are many examples of Nissan engineers really driving forward the business.”\nYes!  There are!  And every single one of them would collectively haul your ass back to a theology class.  Or maybe a psychology class.\nJust anywhere the chance exists that you’ll learn some damned morals!\nTo sum it up, this is possibly the most pointless, disgusting thing Nissan has ever created, even surpassing the Cube.  Sure, it’s not going on sale.  And initially, you may question why you should care.  Well…you should care because Nissan is stupid.  They are gaining nothing from this.  It’s about as wild as goose chases get.  Millions of dollars and thousands of man hours are being poured into something that has no logical value whatsoever.  \n\nIn this new video, I describe my reaction to discovering this thing.\n\n<img src=\"https://autobully.micro.blog/uploads/2025/11187918131-0.jpg\"> \n",

				"content_html": "<p>Us drivers of cars with manual transmissions tend to look down on those who drive automatics.  It’s like an exclusive club.  Only the extremely talented, gorgeous-looking, and legendary  athletes of yore are allowed in. \nWell, that’s bullshit.  So those of  you that know the “standard” can keep your mouths shut and bask in the  quiet satisfaction that you’re saving the planet. \nThe truth is, for those of you that don’t know, driving “stick” is totally simple.  Once you understand the basic concepts of how the transmission and clutch work together, you can figure it out with no real instruction at all.  So with that in mind, I’d like to tell you that automatic transmissions just….suck.  Really.\n Mind you, I’m not talking about Dual-Clutch Transmissions, SMGs (Sequential Manual Gearboxes,) or any of that fancy stuff that has only recently become somewhat popular in the mainstream (affordable) auto market.  I’m talking about automatics with a torque converter, that magically inefficient device that has carried America’s laziness in driving for the last 50 years.\nNow before I go on, I suppose I owe you a technical explanation.  Let’s start with the basics.  First off, a transmission is the device that separates the engine from the wheels.  With both automatic and manual transmissions, “gears” are used to vary the ratio between the engine’s crankshaft and the drive shaft going to the wheels.  It’s essentially a buffer between the engine’s relative consistency and the inconsistent world that you drive in.But that’s not quite all there is.  Traditional transmissions require an interruption in power from the engine to shift these “gears,” and to come to a stop at a traffic light, in your driveway, or on the side of the highway to pick up a hooker.  In manuals, this is typically accomplished with a clutch, a device that could most simply be explained as two plates that are pressed together to couple, and brought apart to become independent.  A clutch is normally coupled, it’s when the clutch petal is pushed in that the plates separate, and the transmission is isolated from the engine.  Automatic transmissions use a type of fluid coupling to accomplish the same task, called a torque converter.  The advantage of the latter is that, when paired with an automatic transmission, the driver only requires one input to get the car moving and vary its velocity, and that is the accelerator pedal.  A manual transmission requires three inputs, on the other hand. (Accelerator pedal, clutch, and gearshift.)  In my mind, the torque converter has some huge disadvantages in a world where millions are spent to save 20 lbs. on one car design.  \nHave you ever noticed that cars equipped with manuals are usually noticeably more fuel efficient than their automatic counterparts?  Some of that could be attributed to the greater control that comes with manuals, but most of it is from the torque converter’s main design flaw.  A clutch can be completely disengaged and completely engaged.  So, with a healthy vehicle, there is 0% of the engine’s power moving to the transmission when the clutch pedal is depressed fully.  Likewise when the clutch pedal is allowed completely out, the clutch essentially becomes a shaft, and 100% of the engine’s power is being fed to the transmission.\nA torque converter couples via fluid, however, meaning there is never a solid mechanical connection between the engine and the transmission.  (Unless the transmission is equipped with a lock-up clutch, which is essentially a clutch that locks the torque converter mechanically when it is no longer required to dump the engine’s energy into friction.  These are becoming more and more common, but the majority of vehicles on the road are missing them.)  This means that a traditional torque converter is never 100% efficient. \nAlso, a torque converter is never completely disengaged.  When sitting at a traffic light, the driver typically lightly applies the brakes to hold the car from moving forward.  Have you ever considered what you’re doing?  The engine is basically dumping energy into the torque converter in the form of friction.  It is literally no different from holding the gas and the brakes at the same time. \nWhat the hell?  How is that accepted in a world where Al Gore and Prius’s exist?\nOh wait!  As United States citizens, we’re lazy as shit!\n84% of cars sold in North America are equipped with an automatic transmission, as opposed to 20% in Europe.\nYou could make the excuse that we love automatics because of all our stop-and-go traffic, and yet, as a citizen of the Midwestern U.S, I see automatics MUCH more often than I see traffic congestion.  \nThe real answer is that we just don’t want to bother with a clutch pedal and a gearshift when we could be texting or doing makeup.\nLuckily, the great minds of our time have come up with solutions that adapt to us so that we don’t have to adapt to them. (As always.)  Probably the simplest is the aforementioned “lock-up clutch,” which eliminates the inefficiency of the torque converter by mechanically coupling at high speed.  But that doesn’t exactly solve the problem of sitting over a nice gas to friction converter at traffic lights.  Well here’s a tip.  When you stop at a traffic light, bump your shift lever one up into neutral.  It shouldn’t require that you hold a safety button to go back and forth between Drive and Neutral.  This prevents that unnecessary friction.  Combine that with a lockup clutch, and you’re basically driving a manual!……Except without the enjoyment.\nYou could call this a rant on one of the most successful inventions the modern automobile has ever seen….because it is.  And I doubt you’ll hear anyone else complain about it.  But there really are flaws in the design that I wish consumers would figure out.  Before all this hybridism, eco-mindedness, and hippie-crazed green malarkey, maybe we should eliminate the evil energy-wasting beast that is the torque converter. </p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
